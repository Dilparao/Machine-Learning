# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning project using python
This project is based on fake - real classification , the datasets used are CE802_Ass_2019_Data which is split into training and test set 
in the ratio 75,25. The different classifiers are used and the accuracy score is predicted.
The one with the best accuracy score classifier is then used which is SVM , is then used on the test set and the label is predicted whether 
the news is real or fake.
It generates a SVM_test.csv containing the results of the test set.
